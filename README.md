# Things I want to read/learn:
I like to learn stuff about data science, how application is built around them, and any useful stuff that make data science more efficient.

1. Design Data Intensive Application ✅
2. High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans
3. System Design (https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
4. Clean Code in Python: Refactor your legacy code base
5. Advanced Python Programming: Build high performance, concurrent, and multi-threaded apps with Python using proven design patterns


Recently, I make this plot with R. (Haven't used R for quite some time.)
