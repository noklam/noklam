Recently, I make this plot with R. (Haven't used R for quite some time.)

Plot with rayshader in R, data from USGS Landsat 8 + 30m resolution SRTM DEM data

I like to learn stuff about data science, how application is built around them, and any useful technique that can improve my efficiency.

Things I want to read/learn in 2021:
1. Design Data Intensive Application
2. High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans
3. Cloudera Impala (I need to use Impala for my work) or any advance SQL tuning book
3. K8s/Kubeflow-  how is it useful for a data scientist
