Data Scientist that know a little bit of programming -> programmer that know a little bit of data science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data science/machine learning. I want to apply ML to solve real-world problem.

# Some Developer Principles I Learnt over the years
Do

Don't
* TDD - **T**rust-**D**riven **D**evelopment (Don't Test, Don't Commit, Copy & Paste without checking, Trust is the key.)

# Things I want to read/learn in 2021:
I like to learn stuff about data science, how application is built around them, and any useful stuff that make data science easier

1. Design Data Intensive Application âœ…
2. High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans
3. System Design (https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
4. Do some LeetCode - finished 200 Questions and can solve most medium level question comfortably.
5. Clean Code in Python: Refactor your legacy code base
6. Advanced Python Programming: Build high performance, concurrent, and multi-threaded apps with Python using proven design patterns

# Others
I feel like it would be interesting to learn some low level programming language as I think that knowing Python only is missing out a lot. It's always great to have more options.

1. I really want to brush up some CS basics like OS/compiler/DB/network 

If you know some good resource to learn C++/Rust for a Python programmer, please let me know!

Recently, I make this plot with R. (Haven't used R for quite some time.)
