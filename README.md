### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹
<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=noklam" alt="noklam" /> </p> 

Data Practitioner, Software Engineer (Mostly Python, my goal is to learn more about Rust in 2024 and build something useful with both)

I have said I want to learn Rust for many years, I have read through some book but never actually use Rust for anything. I don't know if I ever need Rust for a job, but I want to push myself for doing it this year. I want to rebuild the first version of `ruff` in Python and Rust as an exercise, stay tuned!
